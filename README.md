I am a passionate and top-quality JavaScript developer with great hands on React.js, Gatsby.js and Node.js or more specifically I am a Full Stack Developer with more than 8 years of practice and exceptional expertise in JavaScript.  I develop reliable, testable and high-performing web applications using top-notch technologies

I have solid understanding of web and mobile app development life cycle, user interface designing and quality assurance. While working on a new project, i follow complete "Software Development Life Cycle" starting with requirements gathering so that i can have a clear understanding of clients needs and final deliverable.

The Tech Stack I primarily deal with is the following 💻:

▪️Back-End: Node.js (Express.js), Nest.js
▪️Front-End: React (Redux, TypeScript) / HTML5/CSS3 , Bootstrap 3/4
▪️Data visualization (Highcharts, Chart.js, D3.js etc.)

▪️Amazon Web Services: EC2, S3, RDS, CloudSearch etc.

If you are in a middle of some rough concept or already have specifications, I'll work with you to turn your idea into a reality. Moreover, I am also capable to do modifications or upgrade your existing application. I can learn your code base quickly, fix bugs, refactor messy code, and add new features as needed.
I am aiming at long-term and successful collaboration with clients, that’s why I am trying to deliver valuable increment with the best possible quality.
Thank you for being here on my profile
